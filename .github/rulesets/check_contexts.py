"""Refuse a ruleset that has drifted from the workflows it is supposed to gate.

`docs/github-security.md` names two ways this configuration fails quietly, and a warning in a document
is exactly the kind of protection this repository does not accept elsewhere:

- **A required context that no job produces is a permanent block, not an error.** The pull request
  waits for a check that will never report. Renaming a job does this; so does a typo.
- **A job whose context nothing requires runs and gates nothing.** Adding Python 3.14 to `ci.yml`
  creates `python (3.14)`, which goes green on every pull request and blocks nothing until somebody
  remembers this file. That drift *looks* like coverage, which is what makes it the more dangerous of
  the two.

So this compares the contexts the workflows actually produce against the contexts `main.json` requires,
in both directions, and fails on any difference. What it cannot see is the live ruleset on GitHub -
that needs a token this job does not have, and should not. It checks the half that drifts when someone
edits a workflow, which is the half that drifts.

Run from the repository root:
